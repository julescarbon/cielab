Haha well the url is a misnomer... This is actually a Hunter Lab color picker.  CieL\*a\*b\* has gamut issues that make it more difficult to work with.  Lab color is more appealing in a picker than RGB or HSL, if only for the reason that it is not full of desaturated grays.

Very little to note about this, except if you click in one place and then shift-click in another, it will generate a 6-part gradient.

Uses the functions from [http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=MATH](http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=MATH)
